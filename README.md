# Map-translation-Hindi-
Project
This project focuses on translating and transliterating place names from English to Hindi while visualizing them on an interactive map. The primary goal is to build an automated system that processes large-scale geographical data, stores translated and transliterated names in a database, and displays them using Folium-based mapping.
